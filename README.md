## NextJS and Serverless

This is a working example of [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and [Serverless](https://serverless.com/).

This basic site is deployable to AWS using API Gateway and Lambda functions.

### Troubleshooting

- If `waiting for localhost` is hanging during `yarn start`, stop the process and try `yarn build`. Afterwards, try `yart start` again.
